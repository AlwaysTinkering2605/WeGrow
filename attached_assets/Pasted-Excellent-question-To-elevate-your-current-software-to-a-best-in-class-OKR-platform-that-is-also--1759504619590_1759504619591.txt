Excellent question. To elevate your current software to a "best-in-class" OKR platform that is also ISO 9001 compliant, you need to capture more specific, measurable, and auditable information. Your current software provides a good start by capturing the objective's title, description, and alignment with a company objective, but it's missing the critical components that drive performance and ensure compliance.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the information you should capture, structured to meet best-in-class standards and the rigorous requirements of ISO 9001 for quality management systems.

Part 1: Foundational "Best-in-Class" OKR Information

At its core, an OKR system must effectively track not just the objective, but also the measurable results. Your current system appears to be missing the "Key Results" component entirely.

Objective-Level Information (What you need to add):

Owner: While a team is selected, a single individual should be designated as the accountable owner for the objective. This clarifies responsibility.

Objective Type: Classify objectives as "Committed" (goals that are expected to be achieved) or "Aspirational" (stretch goals that are more challenging). This provides context for performance evaluation.

Key Results-Level Information (The critical missing piece):
For each Objective, you need to be able to define 3-5 Key Results. These are the measurable outcomes that determine if the objective has been met. For each Key Result, you must capture:

Key Result Title: A clear, concise description of the measurable outcome.

Owner: The individual responsible for the Key Result.

Metric Type: How the Key Result will be measured (e.g., Percentage, Numeric, Currency).

Start Value: The baseline metric at the beginning of the period.

Target Value: The desired value to be achieved.

Progress Updates: The system must allow for regular, time-stamped updates on the current value of the metric. Best-in-class platforms facilitate weekly check-ins.[1][2]

Confidence Score: A regularly updated score (e.g., 1-10 or a percentage) indicating the owner's confidence in achieving the Key Result.[3] This is a crucial forward-looking metric.

Example:

Objective: Deliver flawless service and proactive support to North Glasgow.

Key Result 1: Improve customer satisfaction (CSAT) score from 85% to 92%.

Key Result 2: Reduce average ticket resolution time from 48 hours to 24 hours.

Key Result 3: Increase the percentage of proactive support tickets initiated from 5% to 15%.

Part 2: Information for ISO 9001 Compliance and Auditing

ISO 9001 requires that your quality objectives are measurable, monitored, communicated, and aligned with your organization's strategic direction and quality policy.[4][5] Your OKR system is the perfect tool to manage and document this.

To make your OKR software compliant and audit-ready, you need to capture the following:

1. Explicit Alignment with Quality Management System (QMS)

Link to Quality Policy: Objectives should be directly linked or tagged to the specific tenets of your company's Quality Policy they support.[4][5]

Relevance to Conformity: For relevant objectives, you should be able to document how they ensure the conformity of products and services and enhance customer satisfaction, as required by the standard.[4]

2. Comprehensive Planning and Resourcing

As per ISO 9001:2015 (Clause 6.2), when planning how to achieve quality objectives, you must determine:

What will be done: This is covered by the objective and key results.

What resources will be required: Add a field to document necessary resources (e.g., budget, personnel, tools).

Who will be responsible: This is covered by the "Owner" field.

When it will be completed: This is covered by the "Start and End Date".

How the results will be evaluated: This should be inherent in the measurable Key Results, but you could add a field to specify the method of evaluation (e.g., "Monthly CSAT survey analysis").[4][6]

3. Rigorous Monitoring, Measurement, and Evidence

Performance Indicators: Your Key Results act as the performance indicators required by ISO 9001.[4][7]

Evidence and Attachments: Your software must allow users to attach or link to evidence that substantiates progress or completion. This is crucial for an audit trail. Examples include customer survey reports, performance data exports, or project completion documents.

Audit Trail: The system must have an un-editable log of all changes. An auditor needs to see who created the objective, who updated it, when progress was logged, and what changes were made over time.

4. Analysis and Management Review

Reporting and Dashboards: The software must be able to generate reports and dashboards that can be used directly in management review meetings.[1][8][9] These reports should clearly show progress against all objectives, highlighting which are on track and which are at risk.

Nonconformity and Corrective Actions: For objectives that are failing or have failed, the system should have a mechanism to link to or document any resulting corrective actions, demonstrating a commitment to continual improvement as required by ISO 9001.

By implementing these changes, you will transform your software from a simple objective-setting tool into a powerful, data-driven platform for execution that provides the structure, evidence, and traceability required for both high performance and ISO 9001 compliance.
