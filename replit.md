# Overview

Apex is a Performance & Development Platform designed for cleaning companies to integrate Personal Development Plans (PDPs) with Objectives and Key Results (OKR) in a simple, mobile-first application. The platform targets three user types: cleaning operatives, area supervisors, and senior leadership, with a focus on goal alignment from company level down to individual objectives.

**Recent LMS Implementation (Sept 24, 2025)**: Successfully completed Phase 1 ApexLMS with comprehensive Learning Management System featuring advanced learning paths, training matrix integration, auto-certification system, real-time data sync, and closed-loop integration. All deliverables architect-approved and meet ISO 9001:2015 Clause 7.2 compliance requirements for competence management.

**Job Role Normalization & Org Charts (Oct 1, 2025)**: Implemented normalized job role architecture with proper referential integrity, foreign key constraints, and dual organizational chart views. Completed full-stack implementation including backend validation, deletion safety checks, and comprehensive UI with both structural (job role hierarchy) and operational (manager chain) org chart views. Added nested tree view components for hierarchical org chart visualization with expand/collapse functionality.

**Profile Edit Security Fix (Oct 1, 2025)**: Fixed critical bug where Profile edit dialog included "User Role" field that was clearing user's system role on save. Profile edit now only contains personal information fields (name, phone, title, image). Role assignment is exclusively in User Management for leadership users.

**Job Role Management UI (Oct 2, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive Job Role Management interface for leadership users with full CRUD functionality. Features include searchable table view, create/edit dialogs with type-safe form validation, delete confirmation with safety checks, and seamless integration with User Management filters. Supports hierarchical role structure with parent role selection and proper validation of organizational reporting relationships.

**Org Chart Visual Enhancement (Oct 2, 2025)**: Updated job role hierarchy visualization to use level-based indentation instead of tree-depth indentation. All roles with the same organizational level (1-5) now align vertically regardless of parent-child relationships, making the hierarchy clearer and more consistent.

**Vimeo Integration & Privacy Video Support (Oct 2-3, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive Vimeo URL extraction utility with support for 10+ URL patterns including privacy-enabled sharing links. The `extractVimeoVideoId()` function normalizes all Vimeo URL formats and preserves privacy hashes in "ID/hash" format for privacy-enabled videos (e.g., "1119689619/3217accce7"). Supports path-based privacy (`vimeo.com/ID/hash?share=copy`), query-based privacy (`vimeo.com/ID?h=hash`), player embeds, channels, groups, albums, showcases, and direct video links. VimeoPlayer component now detects privacy format and loads videos correctly: privacy videos load via full URL (`https://vimeo.com/ID/hash`), public videos load via numeric ID. Applied to all course/lesson form submission handlers with end-to-end testing confirming successful privacy video playback. Fixed critical bug in `apiRequest()` function where incorrect calling pattern caused HTML error pages. Added vimeo_video_id column to courses and lessons tables with full backend persistence support.

**Department Normalization (Oct 3, 2025)**: Completed comprehensive database normalization of department taxonomy into single source of truth. Created normalized `departments` table with proper UUID primary keys, sort ordering, and active status tracking. Migrated all existing data from varchar department fields to departmentId foreign keys across job_roles, teams, competencies, and learningInsights tables. Implemented full backend CRUD API at `/api/departments` with leadership authorization, usage validation before deletion, and proper 404 handling. Updated JobRoleManagement and TeamManagement frontend components with department Select dropdowns consuming departments API, proper sentinel value handling ("none" â†’ undefined/null normalization), and department name display via lookup. Created comprehensive Department Management UI at `/departments` for leadership users with full CRUD functionality: searchable table view, create/edit dialogs with form validation, delete confirmation with usage checks, sort order management, and active/inactive status toggling. Seeded 7 departments: Operations, Quality & Operations, Administration, Human Resources, Sales & Business Development, Finance, Quality Ops. End-to-end testing verified job roles, teams, and departments can be created/edited with proper data persistence and referential integrity.

## Organizational Structure

### Job Role Hierarchy
The platform implements a normalized job role architecture with proper relational database design:

**Database Schema:**
- `job_roles` table: Master data for organizational job roles with hierarchical structure
  - Unique ID, name, and code for each role
  - Hierarchical level (1-5): Entry level to Director
  - Optional department categorization
  - Self-referencing FK `reportsToJobRoleId` for structural hierarchy
  - Foreign key constraints with ON DELETE SET NULL for data safety
  - Performance indexes on FK columns and level field

- `users.jobRoleId`: Foreign key to job_roles table
  - Links each user to their assigned job role
  - Replaces deprecated enum-based `job_role` field
  - FK constraint ensures referential integrity

- `learning_path_job_roles`: Many-to-many junction table
  - Links learning paths to specific job roles
  - Enables role-based training requirements
  - Supports targeted competency development

**Current Job Roles (8 roles across 5 levels):**
- Level 5: Director (1 user)
- Level 4: Manager (4 users)
- Level 3: Supervisor (10 users)
- Level 2: Team Leader (Contract), Team Leader (Specialised) (25 users total)
- Level 1: Cleaner (Contract), Cleaner (Specialised), Mobile Cleaner (140 users total)

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/job-roles` - List all active job roles
- `GET /api/job-roles/:id` - Get specific job role details
- `POST /api/job-roles` - Create new job role (leadership only, with Zod validation)
- `PUT /api/job-roles/:id` - Update job role (leadership only, with self-reference prevention)
- `DELETE /api/job-roles/:id` - Soft delete with safety checks (prevents deletion if role is in use or has child roles)
- `GET /api/org-chart/job-roles` - Get job role organizational chart (supervisor/leadership)
- `GET /api/org-chart/managers` - Get manager chain organizational chart (supervisor/leadership)

**Safety Features:**
- Zod validation on all create/update operations
- Self-reference prevention (role cannot report to itself)
- Deletion safety checks (prevents orphaned users and broken hierarchies)
- Foreign key constraints with proper ON DELETE behavior
- Performance indexes for efficient queries

### Dual Organizational Charts

**1. Job Role Hierarchy (Structural View)**
- Shows the ideal organizational structure based on job roles
- Groups roles by hierarchical level (5 to 1)
- Displays employee counts and individual employees per role
- Shows reporting relationships between job roles
- Accessed via `/organization` page under People Management

**2. Manager Chain (Operational View)**
- Shows actual reporting relationships between people
- Based on users.managerId field
- Displays direct reports for each manager
- Shows real manager names and contact information
- Useful for understanding actual operational reporting structure

**UI Components:**
- `Organization.tsx`: Tabbed interface for viewing both org charts with hierarchical tree views
- `TreeNode.tsx`: Reusable recursive tree component with expand/collapse (default: first 2 levels)
  - Supports unlimited nesting, badges, subtitles, counts, and click handlers
  - Level-based indentation and styling
- `JobRoleManagement.tsx`: Leadership interface for managing job roles (create, edit, delete)
  - Type-safe form handling with extended schema supporting 'none' sentinel for optional parent roles
  - Search/filter functionality across name, code, and department
  - Deletion safety checks prevent removing roles with assigned users or child roles
  - All interactive elements include data-testid attributes for testing
- `UserManagement.tsx`: Leadership interface for assigning job roles and managers to users
- Integrated into People Management dropdown in main navigation
- Role-based access control (supervisor and leadership only)
- Responsive layout with employee details
- Real-time data fetching via React Query
